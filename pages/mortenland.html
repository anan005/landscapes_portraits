      Morten Spaberg is a Norwegian portrait and landscape photographer. His
      primary interest is in documenting the different people and landscape
      around him. Spaberg’s photos range from colour, black and white,
      analogue and digital, while primarily adhering to a vertical format.
      Photography is perhaps most potent when it conveys something about the
      world in which we live and its different people and landscapes — that
      which would go unnoticed if we didn’t point a camera at it.<br>
